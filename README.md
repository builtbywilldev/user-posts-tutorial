# 📬 User Posts Tutorial

Practicing API calls, dynamic rendering, and DOM manipulation using `JSONPlaceholder`.

## 🛠️ What This Project Covers

- Fetching user-specific posts from a REST API
- Rendering post data dynamically on the page
- LocalStorage usage to simulate session-based ID storage
- Filtering data on user selection (userId)
- Styling API-driven components with clean UI

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

## 📁 File Structure

📂 user-posts-tutorial/
├── index.html → Landing page
├── user.html → Post listing page
├── index.js → Handles login ID logic
├── user.js → Fetches and renders user posts
├── index.css → Styles for both pages


## 🚀 How It Works

1. You land on `index.html` and choose a user ID
2. That `id` is stored in `localStorage`
3. You're redirected to `user.html`, which fetches:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId={id}

 4. Posts render dynamically with:
- Title
- Body content
- Styled blocks

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Working with APIs
- Async/Await and Fetch
- Mapping over JSON arrays
- Dynamic innerHTML updates
- Error debugging via DevTools
- Real-world-like project structuring
